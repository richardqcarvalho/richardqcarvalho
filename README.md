# Yo, I wasn't expecting you here!

Okay, it might be I was. Welcome to my world then.

I'm Richard, a Brazilian front[and a little back]-end developer who likes to learn about tech and programming things, although it's not that easy. I do work with this and I'm really happy living my passion. I'm still learning about open source, but I really like it and I think it's a really good concept as deeper as is being a good person. And one day I'll be a dope contributor, I hope.
